# Introduction 
This layer helps you to add `mcp2515` module into ASUS-Tinker board.

# Notes
Please note that:
1. `dunfell` branch of `meta-rockchip` use Linux version **5.4.205** by default. But for using `isotp` and `socketcand` you need at least Linux version **5.10.0** or later
2. You need to provide **5v0** supply for CAN transceiver (`tja1050`) because it won't work with **3v3** supply from _ASUS-Tinker_
